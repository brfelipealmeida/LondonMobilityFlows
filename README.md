# Comparative Analysis of Deep Gravity Model and Spatial Interaction Model for non-work flows in London

This study aims to compare and evaluate the performance of two models, namely the Deep Gravity Model and the Production-constrained Model, concerning their ability to predict mobility patterns in London. A comprehensive understanding of their efficacy and applicability is established by comparing the outcomes of these models against observed flow patterns. The study specifically concentrates on the London region, containing its diverse cultural, economic, and infrastructural facets. This comprehensive approach is crucial for comprehending the complex commuting patterns across the city.

### Datasets
Three key datasets are utilised to conduct this analysis: Mobility flows,Points of Interest, and Census 2021. Mobility data offers essential aggregated origin-destination flow data within the hexagons grid system, a unique hierarchical classification to each cell, serving as this study’s foundational index. The additional datasets are integrated into this index through areaweighted spatial joins, ensuring data coherence.

### Deep Gravity Model
The model applied in this analysis was developed by Simmni et al¹, utilising the code available in its [repository](https://github.com/scikit-mobility/DeepGravity).
